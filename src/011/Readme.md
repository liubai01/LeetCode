### Solution description

#### Solution 1: Brute force

Brute force solution with some tricks can pass all tests with low performance. It goes through all possible combination of `(i, j)` and finds one with max volume. The na√Øve brute-force method could pass 47/50 testcases.

One trick is to skip if following solution is impossible:

### File structure

 - `sol.cpp`: baseline solution
 - `testcases\..`: testcases

### Run testcases

No testcase for this problem.
